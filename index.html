			<h1> <b> Welcome! </b> </h1>
			<p> Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Raymond Ignacio, a 2020 graduate of University
				of California, Irvine. I am seeking full-time employment for any position in software
				engineering or web development. Since my graduation, I have been learning more about frontend
				programming, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I still have much to learn in developing
				more professional websites, as I have yet to browse through the Bootstrap library. My 
				current interest is enhancing my knowledge in PHP, as that is my next course of study.
				
				
				am about to enhance my knowledge by learning JavaSript. I graduated in
				University of California, Irvine in March 2020. During the time I took time
				off from education as I have graduated my courses a quarter early. From time to
				time I have been self teaching myself about more coding and I have interests in
				chess, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang and photography.
				
				This is a new line.
