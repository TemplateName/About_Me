			<h1> <b> Welcome! </b> </h1>
			<p> Thank you for visiting my website! I am currently learning how to develop
				more professional websites. My interests at the moment are HTML, CSS, and I
				am about to enhance my knowledge by learning JavaSript. I graduated in
				University of California, Irvine in March 2020. During the time I took time
				off from education as I have graduated my courses a quarter early. From time to
				time I have been self teaching myself about more coding and I have interests in
				chess, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang and photography.
